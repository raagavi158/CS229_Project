# Spotify Plalist Classification

Source code and report for CS 229: Machine Learning final project.

## Abstract

The number of features offered by music streaming services has been growing steadily, with companies constantly working to do better than their competitors. A ubiquitous feature of such services is the ability to create playlists so that the user can choose what genre of music to listen to. In this project, we explore the classification of songs into playlists so that a song that a user 'likes' is automatically classified into an existing playlist. We use five different classification algorithms - K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forests, and train them on data obtained from the Spotify dataset. We use accuracy to measure the performance of the algorithms, and see that the random forest classifier performs the best, and the Naive Bayes algorithm performs the worst.
